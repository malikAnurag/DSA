/**
 * You are given an array of binary strings strs and two integers m and n.
 *
 * Return the size of the largest subset of strs such that there are at most m 0's and n 1's in the subset.
 *
 * A set x is a subset of a set y if all elements of x are also elements of y.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: strs = ["10","0001","111001","1","0"], m = 5, n = 3
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The largest subset with at most 5 0's and 3 1's is {"10", "0001", "1", "0"}, so the answer is 4.
 * Other valid but smaller subsets include {"0001", "1"} and {"10", "1", "0"}.
 * {"111001"} is an invalid subset because it contains 4 1's, greater than the maximum of 3.
 *
 *  Example 2:
 *
 * Input: strs = ["10","0","1"], m = 1, n = 1
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The largest subset is {"0", "1"}, so the answer is 2.
