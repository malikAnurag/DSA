* Algorithm: For Bitwise solution
ones - At any point of time, this variable holds XOR of all the elements which have appeared "only" once.
twos - At any point of time, this variable holds XOR of all the elements which have appeared "only" twice.

So, at any point time below three cases can heppen

A new number appears - It gets XOR'd to the variable ones.
A number gets repeated(appears twice) - It is removed from ones and XOR'd to the variable twice.
A number appears for the third time - It gets removed from both ones and twice.
The final answer we want is the value present in ones - coz, it holds the unique element.

How to remove common 1's bits from ones and twos.

not_threes = ~(ones & twos) --> first we are taking bitwise end between ones and twos and then negate it.
ones &= not_threes --> now if take bitwise & which will remove the common bits
twos &= not_threes  --> now if take bitwise & which will remove the common bits

            ones ^= n;
