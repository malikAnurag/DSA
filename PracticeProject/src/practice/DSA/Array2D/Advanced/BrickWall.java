/**
 * There is a brick wall in front of you. The wall is rectangular and has several rows of bricks.
 * The bricks have the same height but different width. You want to draw a vertical line from the top
 * to the bottom and cross the least bricks.
 *
 * The brick wall is represented by a list of rows. Each row is a list of integers representing the width
 * of each brick in this row from left to right.
 *
 * If your line go through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not considered as crossed.
 * You need to find out how to draw the line to cross the least bricks and return the number of crossed bricks.
 *
 * You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will
 * obviously cross no bricks.
 *
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: [[1,2,2,1],
 *         [3,1,2],
 *         [1,3,2],
 *         [2,4],
 *         [3,1,2],
 *         [1,3,1,1]]
 *
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: TODO: brickWall.png
