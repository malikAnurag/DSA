/**
 * Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a target value in an m x n integer matrix.
 * The matrix has the following properties:
 *
 * Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
 * Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 5
 * Output: true
 *
 *  Example 2:
 * Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 20
 * Output: false
 *
 * Constraints:
 * m == matrix.length
 * n == matrix[i].length
 * 1 <= n, m <= 300
 * -109 <= matix[i][j] <= 109
 * All the integers in each row are sorted in ascending order.
 * All the integers in each column are sorted in ascending order.
 * -109 <= target <= 109

Time complexity : O(n+m)

The key to the time complexity analysis is noticing that, on every iteration (during which we do not return true) either
 row or col is is decremented/incremented exactly once. Because row can only be decremented m times and col can only be
 incremented n times before causing the while loop to terminate, the loop cannot run for more than n+m iterations.
Because all other work is constant, the overall time complexity is linear in the sum of the dimensions of the matrix.

Space complexity : O(1)
Because this approach only manipulates a few pointers, its memory footprint is constant.
