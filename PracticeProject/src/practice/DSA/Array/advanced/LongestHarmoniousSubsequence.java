/**
 * We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its
 * minimum value is exactly 1.
 *
 * Given an integer array nums, return the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its
 * possible subsequences.
 *
 * A subsequence of array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no
 * elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
 * Output: 2
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
 * Output: 0
