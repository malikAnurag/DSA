/**
 * Given an integer array nums, return the number of all the arithmetic subsequences of nums.
 *
 * A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.
 *
 * For example, [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], [7, 7, 7, 7], and [3, -1, -5, -9] are arithmetic sequences.
 * For example, [1, 1, 2, 5, 7] is not an arithmetic sequence.
 * A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.
 *
 * For example, [2,5,10] is a subsequence of [1,2,1,2,4,1,5,10].
 * The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in 32-bit integer.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [2,4,6,8,10]
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: All arithmetic subsequence slices are:
 * [2,4,6]
 * [4,6,8]
 * [6,8,10]
 * [2,4,6,8]
 * [4,6,8,10]
 * [2,4,6,8,10]
 * [2,6,10]
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7]
 * Output: 16
 * Explanation: Any subsequence of this array is arithmetic.
