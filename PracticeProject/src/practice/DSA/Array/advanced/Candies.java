/**
 * There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.
 * You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
 * Each child must have at least one candy.
 * Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
 * Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
 *
 *  Example 2:
 * Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
 * The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
