/**
 * You are given a list of airline tickets where tickets[i] = [fromi, toi] represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight.
 * Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it.
 * All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from "JFK", thus, the itinerary must begin with "JFK". If there are multiple valid itineraries, you
 * should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.
 * For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
 * You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Input: tickets = [["MUC","LHR"],["JFK","MUC"],["SFO","SJC"],["LHR","SFO"]]
 * Output: ["JFK","MUC","LHR","SFO","SJC"]
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
 * Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
 * Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"] but it is larger in lexical order.
