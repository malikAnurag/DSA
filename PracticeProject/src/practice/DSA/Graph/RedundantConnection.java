/**
 * In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.
 *
 * You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added.
 * The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed.
 * The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between
 * nodes ai and bi in the graph.
 * Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes.
 * If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
 * Output: [2,3]
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
 * Output: [1,4]
 *
 * Constraints:
 * n == edges.length
 * 3 <= n <= 1000
 * edges[i].length == 2
 * 1 <= ai < bi <= edges.length
 * ai != bi
 * There are no repeated edges.
 * The given graph is connected.
