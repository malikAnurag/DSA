/**
 * There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where
 * prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.
 * For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
 * Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return any of them.
 * If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
 * Output: [0,1]
 * Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
 * Output: [0,2,1,3]
 * Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
 * So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
 * Output: [0]
